## 📋 IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS

### Phase 1: Testing (PRIORITY)
Before updating frontend, we should test the smart contracts thoroughly.

**Create test files for:**

1. **FraudReportLedger.test.ts**
   - [ ] Test report submission with correct stake
   - [ ] Test report submission with incorrect stake (should fail)
   - [ ] Test validation with correct stake
   - [ ] Test validation with incorrect stake (should fail)
   - [ ] Test double voting prevention
   - [ ] Test voting on own report prevention
   - [ ] Test finalization before 48 hours (should fail)
   - [ ] Test finalization after 48 hours (scenario: APPROVED)
   - [ ] Test finalization after 48 hours (scenario: DISPUTED)
   - [ ] Test stake distribution (APPROVED case)
   - [ ] Test stake distribution (DISPUTED case)
   - [ ] Test fraud score calculation
   - [ ] Test getFraudScorePayable with fee
   - [ ] Test purchaseReportDetails with fee
   - [ ] Test withdrawFees (owner only)
   - [ ] Test all getter functions

2. **Integration Tests**
   - [ ] Test BankRegistry integration
   - [ ] Test non-registered bank cannot submit reports
   - [ ] Test non-registered bank cannot validate

### Phase 2: Deploy to Local Network
```bash
# Start local Hardhat node
npx hardhat node

# Deploy contracts
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/deploy.ts --network localhost

# Save deployed contract addresses
```

### Phase 3: Update Frontend
1. [ ] Export new ABIs from artifacts
2. [ ] Update contract addresses in index.html
3. [ ] Implement validation interface
4. [ ] Implement fraud score dashboard
5. [ ] Implement finalization interface
6. [ ] Implement user dashboard
7. [ ] Test all features on local network

### Phase 4: Testnet Deployment
1. [ ] Deploy to Sepolia/Goerli testnet
2. [ ] Get testnet ETH from faucets
3. [ ] Test with multiple accounts
4. [ ] Verify contracts on Etherscan

## 🎓 Understanding the Economic Model

### Quick Reference: Who Gets What

#### Scenario 1: Report APPROVED (Valid Fraud)
```
Reporter (0.05 ETH stake):
  ✅ Gets: 0.05 ETH + share of wrong validator stakes
  📈 Profit: 6-10% depending on wrong validators

Correct Validators (0.01 ETH stake each):
  ✅ Gets: 0.01 ETH + share of wrong validator stakes
  📈 Profit: 33-300% depending on wrong validators

Wrong Validators:
  ❌ Lose: 100% of stake (0.01 ETH)
```

#### Scenario 2: Report DISPUTED (False Report)
```
Reporter (0.05 ETH stake):
  ❌ Lose: 100% of stake (0.05 ETH)

Correct Validators (disputed correctly):
  ✅ Gets: 0.01 ETH + huge share of reporter stake
  📈 Profit: 200-400%

Wrong Validators (approved incorrectly):
  ❌ Lose: 100% of stake (0.01 ETH)
```

#### Query System
```
Free Score Check:
  - Cost: FREE (just gas)
  - Returns: Score 0-100

Paid Score Check:
  - Cost: 0.0001 ETH
  - Returns: Score + on-chain record

Buy Report Details:
  - Cost: 0.0005 ETH per report
  - Returns: All IPFS CIDs for that customer
  - Example: 3 reports = 0.0015 ETH
```
