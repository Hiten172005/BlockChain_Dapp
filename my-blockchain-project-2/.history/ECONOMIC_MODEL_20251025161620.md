# 💰 Complete Economic Model - Fraud Reporting System

## 📊 Overview

## 🎮 Game Theory: How Winners & Losers are Determined

### Rule 1: Majority Wins
- After 48 hours, votes are counted
- If **APPROVE votes > DISPUTE votes** → Report is **APPROVED**
- If **DISPUTE votes ≥ APPROVE votes** → Report is **DISPUTED**

### Rule 2: Winners Get Rewarded
- **Winners** = Those who voted with the majority + Reporter (if report approved)
- Winners get their stake back + share of losers' stakes
- **Losers** = Those who voted against the majority + Reporter (if report disputed)
- Losers lose their entire stake

## 📈 Scenario 1: Report APPROVED (Valid Fraud Detection)

### Setup
```
Bank A: Submits Report → Stakes 0.05 ETH
Bank B: Validates → APPROVE → Stakes 0.01 ETH
Bank C: Validates → APPROVE → Stakes 0.01 ETH
Bank D: Validates → DISPUTE → Stakes 0.01 ETH ❌
```

### Voting Results
```
APPROVE: 2 votes (Bank B, Bank C)
DISPUTE: 1 vote (Bank D)
→ APPROVE WINS (2 > 1)
```

### Winner/Loser Breakdown
```
✅ WINNERS:
   - Bank A (Reporter) → Voted correctly by submitting valid report
   - Bank B (Validator) → Voted APPROVE (correct)
   - Bank C (Validator) → Voted APPROVE (correct)
   Total Winners: 3

❌ LOSERS:
   - Bank D (Validator) → Voted DISPUTE (wrong)
   Total Lost: 0.01 ETH
```

### Reward Calculation
```
Total Loser Stakes: 0.01 ETH (from Bank D)
Number of Winners: 3
Reward Per Winner: 0.01 ÷ 3 = 0.0033 ETH
```

### Final Payouts
| Bank | Investment | Outcome | Total Received | Profit/Loss |
|------|-----------|---------|----------------|-------------|
| Bank A (Reporter) | 0.05 ETH | ✅ Winner | 0.05 + 0.0033 = **0.0533 ETH** | **+0.0033 ETH** |
| Bank B (Validator) | 0.01 ETH | ✅ Winner | 0.01 + 0.0033 = **0.0133 ETH** | **+0.0033 ETH** |
| Bank C (Validator) | 0.01 ETH | ✅ Winner | 0.01 + 0.0033 = **0.0133 ETH** | **+0.0033 ETH** |
| Bank D (Validator) | 0.01 ETH | ❌ Loser | **0 ETH** | **-0.01 ETH** |

### Key Insight
> **Bank A (Reporter) made a profit of 0.0033 ETH for detecting fraud!** This directly incentivizes fraud detection and reporting.

## 📉 Scenario 2: Report DISPUTED (False Report)

### Setup
```
Bank A: Submits Report → Stakes 0.05 ETH ❌
Bank B: Validates → DISPUTE → Stakes 0.01 ETH
Bank C: Validates → DISPUTE → Stakes 0.01 ETH
Bank D: Validates → APPROVE → Stakes 0.01 ETH ❌
```

### Voting Results
```
APPROVE: 1 vote (Bank D)
DISPUTE: 2 votes (Bank B, Bank C)
→ DISPUTE WINS (2 > 1)
```

### Winner/Loser Breakdown
```
✅ WINNERS:
   - Bank B (Validator) → Voted DISPUTE (correct)
   - Bank C (Validator) → Voted DISPUTE (correct)
   Total Winners: 2

❌ LOSERS:
   - Bank A (Reporter) → Submitted false report
   - Bank D (Validator) → Voted APPROVE (wrong)
   Total Lost: 0.05 + 0.01 = 0.06 ETH
```

### Reward Calculation
```
Total Loser Stakes: 0.06 ETH
Number of Winners: 2
Reward Per Winner: 0.06 ÷ 2 = 0.03 ETH
```

### Final Payouts
| Bank | Investment | Outcome | Total Received | Profit/Loss |
|------|-----------|---------|----------------|-------------|
| Bank A (Reporter) | 0.05 ETH | ❌ Loser | **0 ETH** | **-0.05 ETH** |
| Bank B (Validator) | 0.01 ETH | ✅ Winner | 0.01 + 0.03 = **0.04 ETH** | **+0.03 ETH** |
| Bank C (Validator) | 0.01 ETH | ✅ Winner | 0.01 + 0.03 = **0.04 ETH** | **+0.03 ETH** |
| Bank D (Validator) | 0.01 ETH | ❌ Loser | **0 ETH** | **-0.01 ETH** |

### Key Insight
> **False reporting is severely punished!** Bank A lost 0.05 ETH, while validators who caught the false report earned **300% profit** (0.03 ETH profit on 0.01 ETH stake).

## 🔍 Scenario 3: Query System

### Option 1: Free Score Check
```solidity
getFraudScore(customerAddress) → Returns: 0-100 score
```
- **Cost**: FREE (only gas)
- **Use Case**: Quick decision for loan approval
- **Returns**: Score based on APPROVED fraud reports

### Score Interpretation
| Score | Risk Level | Meaning |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| 81-100 | ✅ CLEAN | No approved fraud reports |
| 51-80 | 🟡 LOW RISK | 1-2 approved reports |
| 21-50 | 🟠 MEDIUM RISK | 3-5 approved reports |
| 0-20 | 🔴 HIGH RISK | 6+ approved reports |

### Option 2: Paid Score Check (On-Chain Record)
```solidity
getFraudScorePayable(customerAddress) → Returns: 0-100 score
```
- **Cost**: 0.0001 ETH
- **Use Case**: When you need proof of the query
- **Returns**: Same as free version
- **Benefit**: Creates permanent on-chain record

### Option 3: Buy Detailed Reports
```solidity
purchaseReportDetails(customerAddress) → Returns: IPFS CIDs[]
```
- **Cost**: 0.0005 ETH × number of reports
- **Example**: Customer has 4 reports → Cost = 0.002 ETH
- **Use Case**: Deep investigation before high-value loans
- **Returns**: Array of IPFS CIDs (access to all evidence)

#### Example Query Flow
```
1. Bank X checks Customer Y's score (FREE)
   → Score: 25 (MEDIUM RISK, 4 reports)

2. Bank X decides: "I need to investigate"
   → Calls purchaseReportDetails()
   → Pays: 0.0005 × 4 = 0.002 ETH

3. Bank X receives 4 IPFS CIDs:
   → "QmXyz123..." (Report from Bank A)
   → "QmAbc456..." (Report from Bank B)
   → "QmDef789..." (Report from Bank C)
   → "QmGhi012..." (Report from Bank D)

4. Bank X downloads evidence from IPFS (Pinata)
   → Reviews documents, photos, transaction history
   → Makes informed lending decision
```

### 2. False Reporting is Expensive ❌
- Loss: 0.05 ETH (100% of stake)
- Creates strong disincentive for spam/false reports

### 3. Validation is Profitable ✅
- Correct validators earn 33-300% profit depending on scenario

- Creates incentive to review evidence carefully

### 5. Query System Creates Revenue Stream 💰
- Fees accumulate in contract
- Owner can withdraw for system maintenance
- Future: Could be distributed to active participants

### 6. Network Effects 🌐
- More validators = More reliable consensus
